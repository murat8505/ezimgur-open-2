ezimgur-open-2
==============

Version 2 of the ezimgur android app.

App layer is being rewritten to use some newer features and libraries available (such as Dagger, Robospice, etc...), and to have more maintainable code (first version was used to learn android). Also using a newer version of the sdk, will not have to deal with compatibility issues as much.

Goal is to add complete functionality that is available from the API (unlike the first version of the app). 

Contributions are welcome. Please reach out for API keys (though you should be able to create new keys for testing through imgur).
